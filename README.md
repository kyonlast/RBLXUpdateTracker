I'm doing this for a private friend group server I'm in. We solve puzzles and with this bot, our chances on being first to solve puzzles will increase drastically

A discord bot that tracks a game's data, updating and notifying whenever the game updates while specifying what subplace(s) got updated. Furthermore, it tracks badges and notify us whenever the badge count increases (ex: 1 to 3 or 3 to 5). The bot will fetch these datas by using the Roblox public APIs. The bot will use discord webhooks for it's updates. 

The possible commands will be:
!addgame <universeid> 
!removegame <universeid>
!listgames
!addbadge <badgeid>
!removebadge <badgeid>
!listbadges
